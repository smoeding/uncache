.TH UNCACHE 8 "28 July 2021"
.SH NAME
uncache \- remove cached files from the pagecache
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uncache
.RI [ \-0 | \-\-null ]
.RI [ \-n | \-\-dry-run ]
.RI [ \-v | \-\-verbose ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B uncache
reads a list of files from standard input and tries to remove all
cached blocks of these files from the pagecache.
All files must be given as absolute file names.
Unreadable files will be ignored.
.PP
The
.B uncache
program only drops cached blocks for the named files.
This is in contrast to the
.IR /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
sysctl which will drop cached blocks for all files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-0, \-\-null
Files read from standard input are terminated by a null character
instead of by whitespace.
Useful when input items might contain white space, quote marks, or
backslashes.
The GNU find \-print0 option produces input suitable for this mode.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-dry-run
Do not actually do anything.
Can be used together with the verbose option to check which files are
currently in the pagecache.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Verbose mode.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
find /var/lib/mysql -type f | uncache --dry-run --verbose
Show which MySQL data files are currently in the pagecache but do not
purge the cached blocks.
.TP
find /var/log -type f | uncache
Remove cached blocks for all files below the /var/log directory from
the pagecache.
.TP
find /var/log -type f -print0 | uncache -0
The same as before but use zero terminated strings to handle unusual
file names.
